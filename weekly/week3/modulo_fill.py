"""
Modulo can be useful to work with grid structures
- Try experimenting with different increments when filling the grid
- Try adding different colors or shades of gray when filling (use modulo)
- Try modifying the sketch so it is constantly changing
Note: to test results faster, you can put the body of the draw function inside a loop (e.g., 20/30 iterations)
