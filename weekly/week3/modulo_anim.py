'''
 Modulo can be useful to do "infinite" animations
 Here we animate a series of concentric circles and use
 the modulo operator to animate just the movement between a circle and the distance to the next
 giving the illusion of a continuous movement.

 Ideas:
 - Try changing/varying shapes, stroke weights, adding colors
 - The animation is intentionally inside a function:
   - try superimposing multiple "ripples" at different positions
     - this can be done easily by using transformations and calling the ripple function multiple times
   - try varying the parameters for different ripples
 - Note that in Python the % operator will also work with non-integer values
